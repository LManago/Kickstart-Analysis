# Kickstart Analysis

## Overview of Project

- This purpose of this analysis is to trend kickstarter campaigns based on the performace of the campaign. The analysis will show based on the goal size how well a kickstater did, as well as the most opportune time to start a campaign. The kickstarter analysis will also show inopportune times as well. This will analysis will give Louise the tools to make better decisions as to when and how mach she should start her kickstarter campaign.

## Analysis and Challenges

##### Analysis
- I performed the analysis goving different variations of information (i.e outcomes based on launch dates, outcomes based on category's & outcomes based on goals etc.) 

##### Challenges
- Some challenges that I faced were changing the x and y axis on the graph to compare the goal ranges and the percentage for the columns. I overcame the challenges by using google to search a way to change the x & y axis on the graph.

## Results

- The conclusion I drew about theaters from the graph based on launch date was one kickstaters were more successful when they were started in May. I also learned kickstaters were more likely to faile when launched at the beginning or end of the year.

- The analysis that I concluded from the **Outcome based on Goals** sheet was that goals were more likely to become successful when they ranged from 1,000 - 4,999.

- A limitation of the datset would be that the data doesn't tell you how muach each backer gave. We were only hable to looks at the average, but with more information we could see if a few backer gave to the majority of the goal.

- Some possible graphs that could have been used would have been the clustered bar graph and also a clustered column line graph.
